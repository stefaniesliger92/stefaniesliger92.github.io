    <h1> My First Website</h1>
    <h2> There are many reasons why I have chosen to learn how to code: </h2>
    <ul>
    <li> to have an in-demand skillset </li>
    <li> to be able to make a decent living </li>
    <li> to be able to freelance and work remotely </li>
    <li> to challenge myself </li>
    <li> to be able to travel and/or live wherever I want </li>

    <p1>It is very important to me to have freedom within my career. I sought out remote jobs to see which skillsets were most desirable for those positions, and as a result, here I am learning to code! </p1>

    <p2>I am very excited about this journey</p2>
